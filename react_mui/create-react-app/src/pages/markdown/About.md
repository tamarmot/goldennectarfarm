## About the farm

[New York Times Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/travel/01explorer.html?ei=5087&em&en=e4cc1870b1d8e566&ex=1212379200)  

Golden Nectar Farm was originally planted by [Paul Vossen](http://www.paulvossen.com/), a local fruit tree expert and University of California Cooperative Extension Farm Advisor.  He focused on planting a diverse orchard of trees that thrive in Sonoma County, a large blueberry garden, and many table grape vines.

John and Ana Stayton spent 27 years cultivating the farm, applying principles of permaculture and renegerative farming.  They opened the farm to the local community, hosting many [woofers](https://wwoof.net/).  The blueberries were replaced with an ample vegetable garden, and the trees benefitted from composting and companion planting.

John and Ana also focused on sustainable and ecological choices, including a straw bale structure, a cob structure, a yurt; [Eco-Shake](https://www.ecoshakeshingles.com/) roofing shingles and solar panels among other improvements.

Tamar Cohen and Don Gates are the new stewards of the farm, and look forward to growing with it!
